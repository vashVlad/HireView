# HireView — Current State

*Last updated: 2026-07-01 (seeded from HireView-Dev-Log.docx, Architecture-Redesign doc, and git log — update this in place as state changes, don't just append)*

## Status: live, in active use at Brillio

Deployed workflow tool for a recruiter working two roles at once at Brillio. Multi-machine by design (work + personal computer).

## What's shipped

- **JD Analyzer** — paste a JD, get a full LinkedIn Recruiter sourcing brief: wide (discovery, 5k–15k results) and narrow (execution, 500–1k) filter sets, boolean strings, seniority, industries, company size, spotlights.
- **Resume Screener** — bulk PDF/Word upload, Claude scores each against the JD (0–100, must-have 65% / nice-to-have 35% weighting), ranked results, history with status pipeline (New Applicant → Recruiter Screen → Contacted → Screening → Archived). Sub-45 scores excluded from history (raised from 30 on 2026-07-01).
- **Credibility Checker (Phase 4)** — optional second resume + LinkedIn PDF cross-referenced against the screened resume; surfaces discrepancies before a TA call. LinkedIn PDF stored to Supabase Storage during check. Replaced the old "compare" feature.
- **Projects layer** — a project = one open role. Supabase `projects` table; `screenings.project_id` FK. This became the app's core organizing unit.
- **Architecture Redesign (shipped 2026-06-29)** — nav collapsed from 5 items to 2: **Projects** and **All Candidates**. Old routes (`/jd-analyzer`, `/history`, `/tracker`, `/screener`) redirect. Every role/project is a self-contained workspace with tabs: **Filters** (LinkedIn filters, copy buttons), **Screen** (uploader scoped to the role), **Pipeline** (candidate cards — status, flags, notes, credibility), **Tracker** (swimlane TA→L1→L2→In-Person→Offer/Reject, drag-to-reorder, slide-over drawer), **Settings**.
- **Tracker tab (added 2026-06-30)** — was originally a separate page, now folded in as a 5th project tab. Excel export. Scheduled/unscheduled indicator dots.
- **Interview View (added 2026-07-06)** — two popup windows per candidate on pipeline cards: left-half resume/LinkedIn viewer (`/interview/[id]/document`) and top-right notes window (`/interview/[id]`) with AI-generated interview questions (cached, lazy) and debounced notes. Windows tile exactly using complement sizing math. "View resume" button in expanded card also opens the document window.
- **Card redesign (2026-07-06)** — filename removed, credibility signal emoji removed from collapsed state, career story shows role hierarchy (bold headers, subordinate bullets, softer summary), roles displayed oldest-first (chronological), Credibility Check section collapsible (default closed).

## What's shipped (added 2026-07-07)

- **Multi-user auth (Task 1)** — Supabase Auth email/password, `@supabase/ssr` middleware, `/login` page, `user_id` on all three tables, recruiter isolation, admin sees all, `/admin/users` management page. User creation via `createUser` (no invite email) with pre-filled temp password `HireView2025!`. Sign-in is immediate.
- **Analytics dashboard (Task 2)** — `/analytics` admin-only. `screening_batches` aggregate table tracks all runs including below-threshold rejections (`scores int[]`, `passed_count`, `total_count`). 4 stat cards: Resumes Screened / Passed to Pipeline / Filtered Out / Time Saved. Score distribution, daily activity, by-role and by-recruiter tables. Date range + recruiter filter.
- **Calibration feedback UI (Task 3)** — Thumbs up/down in expanded pipeline cards. Thumbs down → correction modal (score slider + reason). `POST /api/history/[id]/calibrate` re-downloads resume + saves as calibration_examples. Core scoring logic untouched.
- **Configurable score threshold (Task 4)** — `score_threshold` column on projects (default 45). Slider in Settings tab. `screen-resumes` reads per-project threshold.
- **SiteHeader account dropdown** — person icon → dropdown with email (green dot), Change password link, Sign out. Admin nav links (Analytics, Team) with visual divider.
- **`/auth/set-password` page** — lets users update their temp password. Accessible via header dropdown.
- **JD file upload** — "Upload file" button in New Role modal. Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT via `POST /api/extract-jd-text` (reuses `extractResumeText`).

## What's shipped (added 2026-07-07, session 3)

- **Access request feature** — "Don't have access? Request it →" link on login page expands a collapsible form (email + name + message). Submissions saved to `access_requests` table + email to vladvashchuk2005@gmail.com via Resend (requires `RESEND_API_KEY` env var). Team page shows amber "Pending requests" section with Approve (creates account with `HireView2026!`) / Dismiss. SiteHeader shows pulsing amber dot badge on Team link when pending requests exist.
- **Keyword highlighting + match counts** — must-have (amber) and nice-to-have (violet) keywords highlighted inline in career trajectory text. Score chips show `X/Y kw` badge for fraud detection visibility.
- **Invite flow overhaul** — switched from `inviteUserByEmail` to `createUser` (no email rate limits, immediate activation). Default temp password `HireView2026!` pre-filled in form.
- **Photo in drawer** — candidate profile photo moved from chip to drawer as circular profile photo; still displays on tracker chip.
- **TypeScript fix** — `cookiesToSet` type annotation in `lib/supabase-server.ts` and `middleware.ts`.

## What's NOT shipped yet

- **Outreach drafting (Phase 5)** — auto-draft LinkedIn messages. Repeatedly listed as next, never started.
- **Impact metrics** — measure screening time + TA false positive rate. Needed for BLUEPRINT Phase 2 validation.

## Deploy / migration status

**Pending as of 2026-07-07 (all manual — Vlad must run these):**
1. `supabase-migration-interview.sql` — adds interview_questions, linkedin_pdf_path, photo_url
2. `supabase-migration-multiuser.sql` — adds user_id to 3 tables + indexes
3. `supabase-migration-threshold.sql` — adds score_threshold to projects
4. `supabase-migration-batches.sql` — creates screening_batches table
5. `npm install` from `C:\Portfolio\HireView` (adds @supabase/ssr)
6. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `.env.local` AND Vercel env vars (get from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → anon public)
7. `UPDATE screenings SET interview_questions = NULL;` — forces regeneration with tighter prompt
8. Create admin account in Supabase Auth → set `app_metadata: {"role":"admin"}` → run data migration (assign existing records to your user_id)
9. Delete any stuck unconfirmed users from Supabase Auth dashboard and re-add via Team page

## Recruiter-facing workflow (as of the redesign)

Projects page → "New role" → paste/upload JD → analyze → name it → land on Filters tab → Screen tab (upload resumes, scoped to role, no re-entering JD) → Pipeline tab (review/flag/note) → Tracker tab (move through interview stages) → All Candidates for cross-role search.
